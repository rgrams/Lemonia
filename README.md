A shoot them up game. The game puts you on a challenge facing waves of lemons. Player need to keep a distance and defeat all of them to prevent them stealing from the player. Inspired by a true story. 

Future development plans
=======
- **Friendly Units** :
    Different appearance of friendly unit sprite, that walks into the battlefield and drops a special item for player to pick up and use. This can include items such as the following. The item will disappear if not picked up on time. If the friendly unit is hit, then it will use that item against player. The enemy on the map will then stand still and spread away as player move through them on the scene and taught at the player. Enemy are invisible at this stage and only be able to get killed once the friendly unit stops after countedown and then angeryly and walks off for player to resume the fight with the lemon. If player kills the friendly unit, the items they carry will never appear again. 
   - **Samurai sword** (1 time ultimate)
      
      When this appears, a large wave of enemy will also enters the scene.
      https://imgur.com/9dHFVT9 here's a link to how it would work. it last for 5 seconds and user can do as many hit as they like.

   - **Shotgun** 
      
      Wider spread damage

   - **Default weapon** 
      
      So player can switch back to it
       
   - **Laser beam** 
      
      A laser that pirce through enermy but has a longer cooldown time. 
      
   - **Two guns** (perm)
      
      An additional gun that mirrors the shot of where the cursor is pointing at
  
- **Enemy types** :
     More variety of Enemy that does different things such as:

  - **Boss enemy**
      
      That walks every 2 seconds slowly towards player. Shakes the screen every time he walks. It has a different apperance and can hold more dmg. 
      
  - **Enemy that taughts**
      
      it laughs but does nothing. If player touch it it will still harm the player
      
  - **Enemy that sings**
      
      It changes the music tone to all weird but nothing else. If player touch it it will still harm the player
      
  - **Massive waves of enemy**
      
      Happens from time to time only when player picks up a different weapon to the default
      
  - **Shooter itself**
      
      Another shooter that looks just like the player. If player kills it then a explotion will happen and reset the stage and score. If you manage to keep it alive and kills other enemy after countdown then it will shake your hand (play a sprite scene) and give you a *confident boost*. While having this *confident boost*, the player will then face massive waves of spawned enemy and becomes invisible for 3 seconds. enermy that touched it will explode (mario super star). 
      
      
- **Misc** :
   Visual changes
  - **End screen**
      
      The credit will come in with the battlefield scene remain as is (so where the player died, how many enemy remain, and the sprays on the floor
      
  - **Cover screen**
      
      A different cover screen at the start
      
  - **Pause menu**
      
      Having a text appearing in the centre of screen to pause. It happens when the screen is out of focus, or hitting on esc. Play a sound for resume and pause. 
      
  - **Confetti**
      
      For every 10,000 score, a confetti will play in the screen
