A classic shoot 'em up game with twist to the conventional playstyle - ask shooter choose their target wisely. The objective is to face wave of enemy that steals from player. Player need to keep a distance and stops them by shooting. From time to time a friendly unit enters and should be protected instead. If shot, then bad things can happen. This game puts player on a journey to explorer their choices while reflect the real world struggle that anyone could expeirence. It hopes to encourage people, puts a smile at the end of the day for anyone expeirenced or currently going through this similar situation. Inspired by a true story. 

Future development plans
=======
- **Friendly Units** :
    Different appearance of friendly unit, that walks into the battlefield and drops a special item for player to pick up and use. This can include items such as the following list. The item will disappear if not picked up on time. If the friendly unit is hit by player, then unit will use that item against player. The enemy on the map will then stand still and spread away as player move through them on the scene and taught at the player. Enemy are invisible at this stage and only be able to get killed once the friendly unit stops after countdown and then angeryly walks off for player to resume the fight with the enemy. If player kills their friendly unit, the items they carry will never appear again. Different kind of blood stains on the field. 
   - **Samurai sword** (1 time ultimate)
      
      When this appears, a large wave of enemy will also enters the scene.
      https://imgur.com/9dHFVT9 here's a link to how it would work. it last for 5 seconds and user can do as many hit as they like.

   - **Shotgun** 
      
      Wider spread damage

   - **Default weapon** 
      
      So player can switch back to it
       
   - **Laser beam** 
      
      A laser that pirce through enermy but has a longer cooldown time. 
      
   - **Two guns** (perm)
      
      An additional gun that mirrors the shot of where the cursor is pointing at
  
- **Enemy types** :
     More variety of Enemy that does different things such as:

  - **Boss enemy**
      
      That walks every 2 seconds slowly towards player. Shakes the screen every time he walks. It has a different apperance and can hold more dmg. 
      
  - **Enemy that taughts**
      
      It laughs and stands still on the side of the screen. Does nothing else. If player touch it it will still harm the player
      
  - **Enemy that sings**
      
      It hanges the music tone and stands still on the side of the screen. Does nothing else. If player touch it it will still harm the player
      
  - **Massive waves of enemy**
      
      Happens from time to time only when player picks up a different weapon to the default
      
  - **Shooter itself**
      
      Another shooter that looks just like the player without weapon and walks slower towards player. If player kills it then an explotion will happen and reset the stage and score (player keeps the weapon and the enmey difficulty). If player manage to keep another self alive and kills other enemy, then after countdown he will walk towards you and give you a hug (play a sprite scene) this gives you a *confident boost*. While having this *confident boost*, the player will then face massive waves of enemy spawned to the field and becomes invisible for 5 seconds. enermy that touched it will explode (mario super star).

  - **Pause menu**
      
      Having a text appearing in the centre of screen to pause. It happens when the screen is out of focus, or hitting on esc. Play a sound for resume and pause. 
      
  - **Confetti**
